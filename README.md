The Required game works as follow:
The Server starts waiting for player.
The players Login to the server, and the server maintain a list of all connected
players.
When the player connects to server, he receives a list of all Available Rooms, and
whom is playing now and the details of the room (if a room has only one player, this
mean you can join it),
Also, he can create a new room.
If a room has an empty location, the player can join this room and ask to play, if the
other player available in the room accept, the game started.
If a room full, and the game is running, then you can join to watch.
